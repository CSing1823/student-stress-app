# üéì student-stress-app

A **Streamlit-based web app** that predicts student stress levels based on their **daily study hours**, **sleep duration**, and **GPA**.  
Built for the **WIE2003 Introduction to Data Science** assignment using a machine learning pipeline with **SVM Classification**.

## üìä Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates a student's stress level (Low, Moderate, High) using daily behavior patterns. It is designed as both an academic exploration and a practical tool to raise awareness about student well-being.

## üîç Data Analysis Workflow (OSEMN Framework)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain**
We obtained the dataset from Kaggle: [Student Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset), which includes anonymized responses from **2,000 university students**.

The dataset contains the following key variables:

- **Study_Hours_Per_Day**: Number of hours a student studies daily  
- **Sleep_Hours_Per_Day**: Average daily sleep duration  
- **GPA**: Reported academic performance on a 4.0 scale  
- **Stress_Level**: Self-reported stress classified as *Low*, *Moderate*, or *High*

Collected via Google Forms, this survey-based dataset offers insight into how academic behaviors and lifestyle factors influence student stress levels. Despite some potential for subjective bias, its clean structure and large sample size make it highly suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scrub**
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent values.
- Binned numeric variables (e.g., `Study_Hours_Per_Day` and `Sleep_Hours_Per_Day`) into categories like `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Explore**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualized the **correlation between study/sleep habits and stress**.
- Tested hypotheses on behavior patterns and stress outcomes.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model**
- Applied **SMOTE** to balance the class distribution.
- Trained 5 models:
  - Random Forest  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - XGBoost  
  - **SVM with RBF kernel** (Best performing model)

- Evaluated performance using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Interpret**
- Identified key behavioral indicators of high stress (e.g., high study hours + low sleep).
- Offered practical recommendations for stress management and lifestyle balance.

## üß† Best Model

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with **RBF Kernel** achieved the highest macro F1-score.
- This model was exported using `joblib` and integrated into the web app.
