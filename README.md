# üéì student-stress-app

A **Streamlit-based web app** that predicts student stress levels based on their **daily study hours**, **sleep duration**, and **GPA**.  
Built for the **WIE2003 Introduction to Data Science** assignment using a machine learning pipeline with **SVM Classification**.

## üìä Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates a student's stress level (Low, Moderate, High) using daily behavior patterns. It is designed as both an academic exploration and a practical tool to raise awareness about student well-being.

## üîç Data Analysis Workflow (OSEMN Framework)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain**
- Collected survey data on students' daily **Study Hours**, **Sleep Hours**, **GPA**, and **self-reported Stress Levels**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scrub**
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent values.
- Binned numeric variables (e.g., `Study_Hours_Per_Day` and `Sleep_Hours_Per_Day`) into categories like `Low`, `Moderate`, `High`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Explore**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualized the **correlation between study/sleep habits and stress**.
- Tested hypotheses on behavior patterns and stress outcomes.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Model**
- Applied **SMOTE** to balance the class distribution.
- Trained 5 models:
  - Random Forest  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - XGBoost  
  - **SVM with RBF kernel** (Best performing model)

- Evaluated performance using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Interpret**
- Identified key behavioral indicators of high stress (e.g., high study hours + low sleep).
- Offered practical recommendations for stress management and lifestyle balance.

## üß† Best Model

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with **RBF Kernel** achieved the highest macro F1-score.
- This model was exported using `joblib` and integrated into the web app.
